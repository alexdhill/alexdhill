PhD student in the Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics program at UC Santa Cruz. 
Undergrad was in Quantitative Biology with a minor in Statistics from the University of Southern California. 

My background is in molecular biology, algorithm design, and applied statistics. 

I don't have much work available publicly, but an interesting assignment of mine is posted at [pairwise alignment](https://github.com/alexdhill/alignment).
