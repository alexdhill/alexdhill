#### Personal statement
I am a PhD student in the [Daniel Kim Lab](https://github.com/UCSC-Daniel-Kim-Lab) at UC Santa Cruz, in the Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics program. Im am interested in the areas of transcriptomics/epitranscriptomics and cancer biology. I presently work with cell-free RNA sequencing data to identify traces of cancer from a patient's blood, to work towards the creation of a powerful, sensitive diagnostic tool. Some of my work includes:
  - The development of the [CREATE](https://github.com/alexdhill/CREATE) pipeline for rapid repeat-aware RNA-seq data quantification
  - Analysis of repeat elements and novel isoforms in blood plasma of Barrett's esophagus + esophageal cancer patients [preprint release soon](https://github.com/alexdhill)

#### Academic background
I recieved a Bachelors of Science in Quantitative Biology with a minor in Statistics from the University of Southern California. I have both academic and research experience in molecular biology (genomics/transcriptomics, cloning, and CRISPR-based editing), machine learning (clustering with PCA*/tSNE, classification with logistic regression, random forests, and scalable vector machines), and applied statistics (data science/hypothesis testing, and estimator evaluation).
